# Typescript
## Compilation

For the current austinquakers.org version as of December 9, 2024, 
we set the target compilation to ES6 or ES2015.  In tsconfig.json:
````
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2015",
    . . .
  },
````

Previously we did not set the compilation target version and Typescript select a low version. 
I found in development this version does to support some javascript iteration
array functions like find or filter.  Raising the target to ES6 fixed this.

The tsconfig.json should also have an "include" and an "exclude" section
to indicate the directories for full compilation.  Additional directories
may be added as needed.

Here is the full configuration:

```typescript
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "removeComments": true,
    "preserveConstEnums": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "ES2015",
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": false
  },
  "include"  : [
    "web.root/application/peanut/components/**/*",
    "web.root/application/peanut/tests/components/**/*",
    "web.root/application/peanut/tests/vm/**/*",
    "web.root/application/peanut/vm/**/*",
    "web.root/application/tests/peanut/vm/**/*",
    "web.root/packages/knockout_view/pnut/admin/**/*",
    "web.root/packages/knockout_view/pnut/components/**/*",
    "web.root/packages/knockout_view/pnut/core/**/*",
    "web.root/packages/knockout_view/pnut/extensions/**/*",
    "web.root/packages/knockout_view/pnut/packages/**/*",
    "web.root/packages/knockout_view/pnut/packages/**/*",
    "web.root/tests/js/**/*"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "web.root/packages/knockout_view/typings/**/*"
  ]
}
```
