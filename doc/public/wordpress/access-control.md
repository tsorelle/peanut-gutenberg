# Access Control in WordPress

## Overview
Peanut access control requires role based authentication, with the ability to assign multiple roles to users. 
Nutshell and Concrete CMS support this natively. Although WordPress supports it internally, the unextended 
installation does not provide a method of assigning more than one role to a user.

This is a legacy of early versions of WordPress which did not use role based authentication, but rather assigned 
a single level of authority. We suggest installing a plugin to provide this capability.

A reliable choice is the [User Role Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/user-role-editor/) plugin.

## Roles:
To fully enable all peanut features, you can set up these new roles and assign "peanut permissions".
Once that is done you can user the "User Role Editor" plugin to assign these roles to users.

In a future release we will create the roles and assign permission automatically when the Peanut plugin is installed.  
For now, you can use the /admin/permissions page.

For larger user communities, you may want to create new roles.

### Peanut Permissions
Note that someone in the "administrator" role has access to all pages and features.  On many sites with just one or two
"managers" you may just rely on the "administrator" to handle all of these tasks.  Another alternative is to assign 
peanut permissions to a newly created role or to an existing WordPress role such as 'Editor'.

Manage the associations between roles and committees on the /admin/permissions page. Click the "Initialze roles" link
to create a standard set of roles and permission assignments. You can add and remove roles from any permission at any time.

## Page Authorizations
To control page access and determine the menu contents based on role and page uri use the /admin/authorizations page.
